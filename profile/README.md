Since then, Mighty Oak has become the premier provider of patient specific solutions for spinal surgery by harnessing
the power of data to make surgery safer and more predictable. We employ advanced analytics which provide surgeons with
the ability to visualize and understand the patientâ€™s spinal anatomy in 3D. Our concierge pre-surgical planning

We are the industry leader in making complex spine surgery safer, through a thoroughly personalized approach.
